# PIL-ImageScaler
This projects provides a Python script leveraging the power of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to perform various image transformations on a batch of images. 

With this script, you can easily automate the following operations:

* ### Open an Image:
    Efficiently open multiple images in different formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF, for further processing.

* ### Rotate an Image: 
    Apply rotation to each image in the batch, allowing you to adjust the orientation according to your needs.

* ### Resize an Image: 
    Scale down or up the dimensions of the images while maintaining the aspect ratio, enabling you to create thumbnails or resize images for specific display purposes.

* ### Save Images in a Specific Format: 
    Convert and save the modified images in a desired format, such as JPEG or PNG, while preserving the original image quality. These saved images are automatically organized in a separate directory, ensuring easy management and accessibility.
